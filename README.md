# How to use
You can import the project to your IDE then run the Main class. It comes with a pre-trained model thats been trained for about 2 hours. If you want to train it yourself then set the train boolean to true in Snake class. Currently it has 6 inputs 2 that show the distance to the apple and 4 that show if moving to any of the directions will kill it. I got a highscore of about 80 with it once. It cant beat the game completely with the default inputs but it can go pretty far if trained long enough.
